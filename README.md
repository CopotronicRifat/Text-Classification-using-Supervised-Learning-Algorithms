# Text-Classification-using-Supervised-Learning-Algorithms
This repository is the thesis work of my undergraduate level and it contains just source code. It does not include the necessary APIs or Data to run the code. 

The demand of text classification is growing
significantly in web searching, data mining, web ranking,
recommendation systems and so many other fields of information
and technology. This paper illustrates the text classification
process on different dataset using some standard supervised
machine learning techniques. Text documents can be classified
through various kinds of classifiers. Labeled text documents are
used to classify the text in supervised classifications. This paper
applied these classifiers on different kinds of labeled documents
and measures the accuracy of the classifiers. An Artificial Neural
Network (ANN) model using Back Propagation Network (BPN) is
used with several other models to create an independent platform
for labeled and supervised text classification process. An existing
benchmark approach is used to analysis the performance of
classification using labeled documents. Experimental analysis on
real data reveals which model works well in terms of
classification accuracy.
